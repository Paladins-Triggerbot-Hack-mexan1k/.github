The Triggerbot is a cheat feature that monitors your crosshair 24/7. When it detects that you’re hovering over an enemy, it instantly fires – **faster than any human could react**. Perfect for flick shots, snipers, or fast-paced duelists.

It’s especially cracked for:

* 🎯 Kinessa (sniper)

* 🏹 Sha Lin (bow)
* 💥 Cassie (burst)
* 🚀 Drogoz (direct hit spam)

No input lag. No wasted bullets. **Just pure precision.**

## ⚙️ Key Triggerbot Features

### ⚡ Instant Fire Reaction

As soon as your crosshair hits the enemy’s hitbox, the trigger activates. Great for snap flicks, close-quarters chaos, or pixel peeks.

### 🎛️ Delay Control

Add microseconds of delay if you wanna make it feel more human. Stay under the radar while still hitting shots like a beast.

### 🧠 Hitbox Filtering

Only want it to fire on the **head** or **upper body**? Set filters so it won’t trigger on random limb shots. Total control.

### 🔄 Toggle & Hotkey Bindings

Easily bind to any key. Flip it on/off mid-game or tie it to ADS for smoother transitions.

### 🛡️ Undetected Build

Uses clean memory injection with **anti-screenshot protection**. Built to bypass Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC) and avoid flagging.
